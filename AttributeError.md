The error **`AttributeError: module 'openai' has no attribute 'error'`** typically occurs when the `openai` library version doesn't match the code being used. The `error` module is available in certain versions of the `openai` library.

Here’s how to fix it step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Verify the Installed OpenAI Library Version**
1. Run this command in a Jupyter Notebook cell or terminal:
   ```python
   !pip show openai
   ```
2. Look for the **Version** field in the output. Ensure it matches the code you’re using:
   - If you want to use the `error` module, the version must be `>=0.27.0`.

---

### **Step 2: Upgrade to a Compatible Version**
To use the latest version of the library:
```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
```

---

### **Step 3: Adjust Your Code**
If the updated library supports the `error` module, modify your exception handling. If not, adjust it to handle generic exceptions instead of relying on `openai.error`.

#### **Updated Code Without `openai.error`:**
If the library version doesn't support `error`, use the generic Python `Exception` class:
```python
import openai

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"  # Replace with your actual API key

def get_llm_response(prompt, model="gpt-4"):
    """
    Sends a prompt to the OpenAI API and returns the model's response using ChatCompletion.
    """
    try:
        # Use ChatCompletion with the new API structure
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
            ],
            temperature=0.7,
        )
        return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    except Exception as e:  # Generic exception handling
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

def print_llm_response(response):
    """
    Prints the response from the LLM.
    """
    print("LLM Response:")
    print(response)

# Test the functions
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example prompt
    prompt = "Write a four-line birthday poem for Tommy."
    
    # Get LLM response
    response = get_llm_response(prompt)
    
    # Print the LLM response
    print_llm_response(response)
```

---

### **Step 4: Test the Installation**
1. Run the updated code.
2. Ensure the functions execute without triggering an error.

---

### **Step 5: Optional: Use Specific Version**
If you prefer using a specific version of the library, uninstall the current version and reinstall:
```bash
pip uninstall openai
pip install openai==0.27.0
```

---

### **Important Notes**
- If you want to catch specific OpenAI errors (e.g., `RateLimitError` or `AuthenticationError`), ensure you're using the correct version (`>=0.27.0`) that includes `openai.error`.
- Restart your Jupyter kernel after upgrading the library.
