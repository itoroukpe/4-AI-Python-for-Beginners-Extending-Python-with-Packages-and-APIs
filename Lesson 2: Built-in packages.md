## Lesson 2: Built-in packages
In this lesson, you'll learn how to work with packages (sometimes called modules) that are built-in to Python.

These packages contain functions that can be made available in your programs using the same import statements you learned in the last lesson.

### The math package
Imagine that you want to show your neighbor's kid how to double-check his trigonometry homework using Python.

Python contains functions in the math package that can let you do trigonometry. Let's load the cos, sin and pi functions and use them.

You make these functions available with the following code:
```bash
# Import from the math package the cos, sin and pi functions
from math import cos, sin, pi
```
The pi you just loaded isn't actually a function, it's a single number:
```bash
print(pi)
```
3.141592653589793
You can check the data type using the type function:
```bash
type(pi)
```
float
Next, define a list of values for which you want to compute cos and sin:
```bash
values = [0, pi/2, pi, 3/2*pi, 2*pi]
```
Iterate through the list of values using a for loop and calculate the cos function for each value:
```bash
for value in values:
    print(f"The cosine of {value:.2f} is {cos(value):.2f}")
```
The cosine of 0.00 is 1.00
The cosine of 1.57 is 0.00
The cosine of 3.14 is -1.00
The cosine of 4.71 is -0.00
The cosine of 6.28 is 1.00
### Try for yourself!
Pause the video and update the code below to calculate the sine instead of cosine!
```bash
for value in values:
    print(f"The sine of {value:.2f} is {cos(value):.2f}")
```
The sine of 0.00 is 1.00
The sine of 1.57 is 0.00
The sine of 3.14 is -1.00
The sine of 4.71 is -0.00
The sine of 6.28 is 1.00
The math package contains a function called floor that rounds values down to the nearest whole number.

Try the code below to use it

ðŸš¨ Alert! This will return an error!
floor(5.7)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[8], line 1
----> 1 floor(5.7)

NameError: name 'floor' is not defined

This code gave an error because you hadn't yet imported the function so that it could be used. Let's do that now:
```bash
from math import floor
```
Now you can run the code:

# Try again
floor(5.7)
5
You can ask the chatbot to tell you about more functions in the math package, or look up the documentation here.

### Calculating useful statistics with statistics
Python also comes with a package for statistics. You can use it to compute common statistics like mean, median, or standard deviation.

To try it out, let's import the mean and stdev functions from the math package:
```bash
from statistics import mean, stdev
```
First, create a list that contains the heights of a group of friend's heights:
```bash
my_friends_heights = [160, 172, 155, 180, 165, 170, 158, 182, 175, 168]
```
You can now calculate the mean value of the list of heights using the mean function:
```bash
mean(my_friends_heights)
```
168.5
You can also calculate the standard deviation of the heights using the stdev function:
```bash
stdev(my_friends_heights)
```
9.119576013536301
There are other functions in the statistics package that you can import to calculate other statistics, like median, etc. You can read more about the statistics package here - or ask the chatbot!

### Introducting randomness to your programs with random
Python also comes with a random package that generates random numbers and selects random elements from a list. This can be very useful in coding projects! You can read more about random here.

You'll write code here to randomly sample from a list of items. To get started, import the sample function from the random module:
```bash
from random import sample
```
ðŸ¤– Use the Chatbot:
Explain how to use the function sample from the random module.

Create lists of ingredients and that you'll select from and pass to the LLM for recipe suggestions:
```bash
spices = ["cumin", "turmeric", "oregano", "paprika"]
vegetables = ["lettuce", "tomato", "carrot", "broccoli"]
proteins = ["chicken", "tofu", "beef", "fish", "tempeh"]
```
You can use Python to select random ingredients for you from these lists.

The sample function takes two parameters: the list you want to select from, and the number of items you want to select:
```bash
random_spices = sample(spices, 2)
random_vegetables = sample(vegetables, 2)
random_protein = sample(proteins, 1)
```
See what ingredients you selected:
```bash
print(random_protein)
```
### Try for yourself!
Pause the video here, and try running the last two cells again.

You'll see that you get different ingredients each time!
Check the random_spices and random_vegetables variables too and see that they also change
Use an LLM to suggest a recipe for you using those 'randomly selected' ingredients.
Create a prompt that asks an LLM to create a recipe using your randomly selected ingredients:
```bash
prompt = f"""Please suggest a recipe that includes the following ingredients.
â€‹
Spices: {random_spices}
Vegetables: {random_vegetables}
Proteins: {random_protein}
"""
```
Check the prompt to see the ingredients:
```bash
print(prompt)
```
Please suggest a recipe that includes the following ingredients.

Spices: ['oregano', 'cumin']
Vegetables: ['broccoli', 'lettuce']
Proteins: ['tempeh']

Next, import the get_llm_response function from helper_functions.py to use to generate the recipe:
```bash
from helper_functions import get_llm_response
```
Next, pass the prompt to the LLM, store the response in a variable named recipe, and then print the result:
```bash
recipe = get_llm_response(prompt)
â€‹
print(recipe)
```
**Spiced Tempeh with Broccoli and Lettuce Salad**

**Ingredients:**
- 1 block tempeh, cubed
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 4 cups lettuce, chopped
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp cumin
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: lemon juice for dressing

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Tempeh:**
   - In a bowl, mix olive oil, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper.
   - Add cubed tempeh and toss to coat. Let marinate for 15 minutes.

2. **Cook the Broccoli:**
   - Steam or blanch broccoli florets for 3-4 minutes until tender but crisp. Drain and set aside.

3. **Cook the Tempeh:**
   - In a skillet over medium heat, add marinated tempeh. Cook for 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown.

4. **Assemble the Salad:**
   - In a large bowl, combine chopped lettuce and cooked broccoli. Add cooked tempeh on top.

5. **Serve:**
   - Drizzle with lemon juice if desired. Toss gently and serve immediately.

Enjoy your meal!
### Extra practice
Try the following exercises to practice what you have learned. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask the ðŸ¤– chatbot!

### Exercise 1
Write code to import the tan (tangent) function from math, then calculate and print the tan of each value.
```bash
# Write code to import the tan (tangent) function from math
from math import pi
â€‹
values = [0, pi/2, pi, 3/2*pi, 2*pi]
â€‹
# Complete the following code to calculate the tan of each value:
for value in values:
    print (f"The tangent of {value:.2f} is    ")
```
The tangent of 0.00 is    
The tangent of 1.57 is    
The tangent of 3.14 is    
The tangent of 4.71 is    
The tangent of 6.28 is    
### Exercise 2
Write code to calculate the median score in the list of scores below. You'll need to write an import statement as well as use the median function on your data.
```bash
â€‹
scores = [28, 14, 15, 25, 21, 26, 30, 8, 36]
â€‹
# Write code to import the median function from the statistics package
from statistics import median
â€‹
# Calculate the median score
median_score = scores
print(median_score)
[28, 14, 15, 25, 21, 26, 30, 8, 36]
```
### Challenge exercise!
Write code using Python's built-in random package to print a random number between 1 and 10.

Work with a chatbot, or consult the random package's documentation website when you need help.


```bash
# YOUR CODE HERE
from random import sample
my_number = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
random_num = sample(my_number, 10)
â€‹
print(random_num)
```
[4, 3, 1, 9, 6, 8, 10, 5, 2, 7]
