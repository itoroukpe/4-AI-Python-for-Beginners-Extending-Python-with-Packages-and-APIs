## Lesson 5: APIs to get data from the web
In this lesson, you will work with a weather API (Application Programming Interface) to get the current conditions at any location.

Start by importing some helper functions

Note: You are now importing print_llm_response from the aisetup package!
```bash
import os
import requests
from aisetup import print_llm_response
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```
Retrieving weather data from an API
In this section, you'll use an API to retrieve real time weather data from https://openweathermap.org.

Most APIs require an API key. You can think of this as a password that is unique to you.

The API key has been setup for this learning environment, so you don't have to do anything except run the code.

You can visit the openweathermap website for information about setting up an API key to use outside of this learning platform.

Run the following cell to setup the API key for this lesson:
```bash
# Get the Weather API key from the .env file
# https://openweathermap.org/price
load_dotenv('.env', override=True)
api_key = os.getenv('WEATHER_API_KEY')
```
Set up the latitude and longitude coordinates to pass to the API:
```bash
# Store the latitude value in the 'lat' variable
lat = 37.4419   # Palo Alto, CA
â€‹
# Store the longitude value in the 'long' variable
lon = -122.1430
```
Note: Feel free to change the lat and lon values above to your current location or a place you would like to retrieve weather data!

Call the Weather API, passing in the API key and your coordinates.

These are added as part of the url f-string below:
```bash
url = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?units=metric&cnt=1&lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={api_key}"
â€‹```
# Use the get function from the requests library to store the response from the API
```bash
response = requests.get(url)
```
Now extract the data from the response variable:
```bash
# Take the response from the API (in JSON) and assign it to a Python dictionary
data = response.json()
â€‹
# Print
print(data)
```
Note The responses you get from APIs are usually given in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which is a variation on a python dictionary.

Display the weather forecast
To display the weather forecast in a nicely formatted way, you need to extract information from the data dictionary. Let's ask the chatbot how to do this:
```bash
ðŸ¤– Use the Chatbot:

How do I get the temperature, description and wind speed from this data variable:

{'cod': '200', 'message': 0, 'cnt': 1, 'list': [{'dt': 1723831200, 'main': {'temp': 34.14, 'feels_like': 23.94, 'temp_min': 22.84, 'temp_max': 24.02, 'pressure': 1017, 'sea_level': 1017, 'grnd_level': 949, 'humidity': 56, 'temp_kf': 1.15}, 'weather': [{'id': 800, 'main': 'Clear', 'description': 'clear sky', 'icon': '01d'}], 'clouds': {'all': 0}, 'wind': {'speed': 3.18, 'deg': 191, 'gust': 3.83}, 'visibility': 10000, 'pop': 0, 'sys': {'pod': 'd'}, 'dt_txt': '2024-08-16 18:00:00'}], 'city': {'id': 5518301, 'name': 'Carey', 'coord': {'lat': 34.38, 'lon': -100.36}, 'country': 'US', 'population': 0, 'timezone': -18000, 'sunrise': 1723809821, 'sunset': 1723858068}
```
Try the code suggested by the chatbot to save the desired information as variables:
```bash
temperature = data['list'][0]['main']['temp']
description = data['list'][0]['weather'][0]['description']
wind_speed = data['list'][0]['wind']['speed']
```
Print out the results nicely!
```bash
print(f"Temperature: {temperature}")
print(f"Weather Description: {description}")
print(f"Wind Speed: {wind_speed}")
```
Write a better weather report:
```bash
weather_string = f"""The temperature is {temperature}Â°C. 
It is currently {description},
with a wind speed of {wind_speed}m/s.
"""
â€‹
print(weather_string)
```
### Use an LLM to plan your outfit
You can ask an LLM for outfit recommendations based on the current weather conditions at your location.

Setup a prompt with the instructions and the weather report you just created, then pass it to the LLM:
```bash
prompt = f"""Based on the following weather, 
suggest an appropriate outdoor outfit.
â€‹
Forecast: {weather_string}
"""
â€‹
# Print the LLM response
print_llm_response(prompt)
```
### Extra practice
Try the exercise below to practice what you have learned. Don't hesitate to ask the chatbot for help if you get stuck!

Note: To find your current coordinates, you can navigate to Google Maps and right click your location:

Finding your coordinates using Google Maps
```bash
# Complete the code below to get the "feels_like" temperature at your current location
lat = 
lon = 
url = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?units=metric&cnt=1&lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={api_key}"
response = 
â€‹
data = response.json()
feels_like = 
city = data['city']['name']
print(f"The temperature currently feels like {feels_like}Â°C in {city}.")
```
