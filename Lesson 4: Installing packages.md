## Lesson 4: Installing packages
In this lesson, you will learn how to install third-party packages using a command called pip.

Once you have installed a package, you can use functions from the package by importing them using the import command.

### Installing packages using pip
Run the cell below to install the bs4 package:
```bash
!pip install bs4
```
Note: You can safely ignore any warnings you see about upgrading pip.

bs4 is short for Beautiful Soup 4. You can check out the Beautiful Soup documentation if you want to learn more about the package, but it gives you tools to interpret HTML webpages inside Python programs.

Now that you have installed the bs4 package, you can use it in your programs!

First, you need to import the BeautifulSoup function you'll use from the bs4 package, as well as some other packages:
```bash
from bs4 import Beautifulsoup
import requests # let's you download webpages into python
from helper_functions import * 
from IPython.display import HTML, display
```
---
```bash
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
​
import requests # let's you download webpages into python
from helper_functions import * 
from IPython.display import HTML, display
```

### Get data from the web
In this section, you'll "scrape", or download HTML data from a website, in this case from a Batch newsletter published by DeepLearning.AI.

You'll use the requests Python package to download the data from the webpage and make it available in your program:
```bash
# The url from one of the Batch's newsletter
url = 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/the-world-needs-more-intelligence/'
​
# Getting the content from the webpage's contents
response = requests.get(url)
​
# Print the response from the requests
print(response)
```
Note: The <Response [200]> you see is an indication from the requests library that your HTTP request was successful. You can ask the chatbot for details about other codes you might see.

Now that you have downloaded the content from the website, you can display it in the notebook using the following code:
```bash
HTML(f'<iframe src={url} width="60%" height="400"></iframe>')
```
Next, you'll use Beautiful Soup to extract all the text paragraphs from the HTML structure that you retrieved, and save it as a single string. Here is the code to do this:
```bash
# Using beautifulsoup to extract the text
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
# Find all the text in paragraph elements on the webpage
all_text = soup.find_all('p')
​
# Create an empty string to store the extracted text
combined_text = ""
​
# Iterate over 'all_text' and add to the combined_text string
for text in all_text:
    combined_text = combined_text + "\n" + text.get_text()
​
# Print the final combined text
print(combined_text)
```
For more details about how this code works, you can ask the chatbot:
```bash
🤖 Use the Chatbot:

What is the following code doing?

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
all_text = soup.find_all('p')
```
---

### Extracting information from scraped website data using LLMs
You can pass the text you just extracted from the Batch newsletter website to an LLM and ask it to extract the most relevant information for you.

Start by writing the prompt and passing in the text you extracted:
```bash
prompt = f"""Extract the key bullet points from the following text.
​
Text:
{combined_text}
"""
```
Then pass the prompt to the LLM:

​```bash
print_llm_response(prompt)
```
One more example of installing packages
Throughout the courses so far, you've imported helper functions from a file called helper_functions.py using commands like from helper_functions import get_llm_response.

The DeepLearning.AI team has created a third-party package called aisetup that you can use to access the helper functions from the course in your own code outside of this learning platform.

To install it, run the following command:
```bash
!pip install aisetup
```
Now the package is installed, you can import helper functions from it using the import command. For example, if you want to import get_llm_response, you now run this code:
```bash
from aisetup import get_llm_response
```
---
```bash
response = get_llm_response("Why is the programming language called Python?")
​
# Print LLMs response
print(response)
```
### Extra practice
Try the following exercises to test what you have learned. If you get stuck, as the chatbot for help!

### Exercise 1
Modify the following code to answer the following question:

Who built the new short course mentioned in the letter?
```bash
# Modify the prompt
prompt = f"""YOUR PROMPT HERE
​
Text:
{combined_text}
"""
print_llm_response(prompt)
```
### Exercise 2
Use the celsius_to_fahrenheit function in the aisetup package to calculate the Fahrenheit equivalent of 0 degrees Celsius.

You'll need to complete the import statement and the calculation.

​```bash
# Complete the import statement
from
​
# Complete the calculation
zero_celsius_in_fahrenheit =
print (zero_celsius_in_fahrenheit)
```
### Challenge exercise!
Write code that uses the bs4 package to create a string that contains the title element from the Batch newsletter. This is the text that starts "The World Needs More Intelligence".

Hint 1: Titles on webpages are often header elements, with tags like <h1> or <h2>. Hint 2: Ask the chatbot for help, using the code you have already written as a starting point.
```bash
# Your code here
​
title =
​
print(title)
```
